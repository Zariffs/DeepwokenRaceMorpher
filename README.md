```txt
(Note, like before this only works on synapse lol)
-- How to set up--
Make sure to actually extract the contents of this zip

Drag the folder that this text file is in into your synapse workspace folder 
(File explorer, drag and drop, if you can't do this you are fucking retarded)

Put the Lua file into your script folder (Or auto exe if you are weird like that idk)

enjoy.
```
